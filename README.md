A TypeScript-based, strongly-typed state machine library designed to be simple, intuitive, and powerful. 

- Strong Type Safety: Leverage TypeScript's advanced type system to eliminate runtime errors and ensure compile-time safety.
- Easy to Use: Designed with simplicity in mind, allowing for rapid setup and smooth integration into any project.
- Fully Typed Transitions and States: Define and manage your states, transitions, and actions with confidence, using clear and expressive type definitions.
- Minimalistic yet Powerful: Lightweight, with a simple API, but powerful enough to handle even the most complex state-driven logic.

Whether you're building a UI-driven application, handling business workflows, or managing state-heavy processes, this library helps you structure and visualize your states clearly, with complete control over transitions and actions.
